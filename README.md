<h2>About KGE Technologies</h2> 

<p>From January 04, 2023 to March 04, 2023, I worked as a Web Developer Intern at KGE Technologies for a duration of two months. This internship provided me with the chance to use the knowledge I gained in the classroom to create real-world projects. Throughout the course of the internship, I developed an extensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and honed my skills in designing responsive websites.</p>
